== Normal Mode ==

Build a Trello clone using Django REST Framework and Ajax in JavaScript.

Build a REST API

First, using the Django REST Framework, build an API with one resource: tasks.

Your URLs should be nested under /api/. Create an API with the following endpoints:

GET /api/tasks/
POST /api/tasks/
PUT /api/tasks/{id}
DELETE /api/tasks/{id}
The task resource will need the following fields:

id, title, status, priority
Build a UI

Then, build a user interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that works with the Django REST API using Ajax.

You'll need to be able to do all of the following via Ajax...

Create a user and login.
Create/edit/delete tasks.
Re-prioritize tasks.
You can build the UI using vanilla CSS, Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton, LESS, SASS, or anything else of your choosing.

You can build the UI using jQuery, React, Angular, Backbone, MithrilJS, Ember, vanilla DOM JavaScript, or anything else of your choosing.

== Advanced Mode ==

For advanced mode, do everything shown above, plus add functional tests and documentation for your API.

== Epic Mode ==

Get creative, add features and extra functionality.
Put the final style and user experience polish on it!
